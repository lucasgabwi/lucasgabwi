Hello, my name's Lucas Gabriel Witchemichen, I'm 13 years old, and I study at Colégio Estadual Professor Amarílio, and I'm at 8th grade in Junior High School, I'm going to graduate in December 2026, but after, I'm going to Senior High School (or High School). And in 2025, I have a subject of Computational Thinking in my school.
I have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I take medicine for my disorders, and I need to get a GitHub Student Developer Pack, for my studies.
Thank you GitHub for accept me in this platform.
